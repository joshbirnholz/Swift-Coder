# Swift-Coder

## Learn programming with Swift, using problems from [CodingBat](https://www.codingbat.com) and [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net)!

### About

I learned programming through the site [CodingBat](https://www.codingbat.com), which I found extremely effective. For the last couple of years I’ve also taught programming to fifth through tenth graders at [URJ 6 Points Sci-Tech Academy](https://6pointsscitech.org/east/), a science-technology summer camp, using Java and that same site.

This year we are switching to Swift and iOS and I wanted to continue to be able to teach with these practice problems.

So I’ve created this app to let me do just that.

### Instructions

**Xcode must be installed in order for the app to be able to compile your code.** If Xcode is installed in a location other than /Applications/, you can pick a custom path from the **Swift Coder** menu.

If you run the app with the App Sandbox entitlement, code can't affect any other files on your computer, but it will use a different method to test your code that takes a few extra seconds. This is safer, so the App Sandbox entitlement is enabled in the project. You can disable it to speed up running your code.
